# Knights-Travails

## Project

A web window where you can pick your starting and ending location, and the program will find the fastest way a knight can go from your starting location to the goal.

## Demo 

You can run the project [here](https://muudar.github.io/knights-travails/)

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

## Algorithms:

This project represents the chessboard as a **directed graph** . Every move costs the same so we can assume all edges have a weight of 1.

I used dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path here, which runs in **O(V + E l o g V)** , However it is not the only algorithm you have to use.

It was possible to use BFS as it finds the shortest solution in **Undirected Unweighted graphs**. DFS , however, would not find the shortest path.
